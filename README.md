# Python-Essentials-1
Hello! I'm Marcos, I'm currently studying an official degree in programming. However, I'm also taking some courses to complement my training. In this case, a course on the basics of Python. In this repository I will be uploading little by little all the practices, both to help if someone needs it and for those who want to help me. Thanks and best regards.
